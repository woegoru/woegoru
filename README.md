<h2>At the moment, I specialize  </h2>
and actively develop in the direction of game design. I am engaged in drawing characters and environments for pixel art games. 
<br> Also I specialize in programming, website creation and web design, Games and Apps.
<br>
<br>I work in a variety of drawing programs. I am open for cooperation.
<h3>And an interesting fact:</h3> I draw everything not on a tablet, but on a laptop with a mouse!

<h2>A little history:</h2> 
<br>I became interested in drawing in early childhood, after which I entered the art school of academic drawing, which I never graduated from.
<br>After that, I graduated from a music school and a music college and decided to enroll in higher education as a programmer at Voronezh State University. It was only in the last year of my studies that I realized that my soul still lies in creativity and design, but not in programming. After graduating from the IT field, I went into game design and website design and have remained in this field ever since.
